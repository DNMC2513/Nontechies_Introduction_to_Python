# What is Python?

According to a survey by [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1241923/worldwide-software-developer-programming-language-communities/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20survey%2C%20the,programmers%2C%20with%2015.7%20million%20developers.) in 2022, Python was the 2nd most popular programming language in the world, behind Javascript. The following factors account for Python’s popularity:

- Similarity to English.
- Agile syntax. Hence, instead of wasting time wrapping their heads around syntax errors, users can focus on solving the main problems.
- Interpreted language features.
  + There are two types of programming languages: Compiled and interpreted languages. With compiled languages like C and C++, users must conduct extra steps to recompile every time they alter the source code or run it on another device. However, with interpreted language like Python, you can execute it off the bat without any interim steps.

- A hybrid form of both procedure-oriented and object-oriented languages. When it comes to procedure-oriented programming, the language is comprised of functions and modules, which are reusable blocks of code. On the other hand, object-oriented languages are constructed from objects, which are values of any form, such as numbers and texts.
- An instance of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS). Put simply, a FLOSS allows you to share, download, work with its code and include it in free programs/software. For example, to work with Python, it is vital for us to download its standard libraries (sets of functions) and sometimes extended libraries, which of both are free. You can find the source of Python’s standard library [here](), and the source of extended libraries [here]().
- Embeddable and extensible features. For instance, users can write their code in C or C++ and then compile and run them in Python.
- A large active community of users willing to share knowledge and support each other.
  + If you have any questions about coding errors, you can post your question on online forums, such as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
  + Free source code online to learn from.
