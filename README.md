# Nontechies_Introduction_to_Python

 Introduction to Python for people with no experience and background in technology and programming.
 
 Self-learning Python with almost no fundamental knowledge in programming, I deeply understand all the stresses and struggles that other students and workers have to go through when switching from their current fields to data science. Hence, I decided to compile all of my knowledge related to Python and express them in the simplest explanation so people with the same starting point as mine can embark on their Data Science journey more smoothly.
